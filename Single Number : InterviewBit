Q:
  Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example :

Input : [1 2 2 3 1]
Output : 3

Ans:
 int singleNumber(const vector<int> &A) {
    int c = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++)
        c =  A[i] ^ c;
    return c;
}
